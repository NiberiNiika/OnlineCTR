Choose character that is part of the original 8 (crash - pura)
Arcade mode loads the original 8 characters into RAM, plus the one you chose.
Therefore, choosing a character that is not in the original 8, will cause the other player to crash

In Track Selection, let the host browse the tracks, the client should not touch anything

Let the host start the race, the client should automatically copy the server
When the race starts, you should only see 2 racers. If you see 8, something went wrong

While in Track Selection:
-- If you are the server, you can press F9, and then press Up (keyboard, controller, whichever).
This will show you Lab Basement. If you want any Battle track, keep hitting the Up
button to browse battle tracks. Pressing the Down button will go back to Crash Cove.
This is very experimental, so the names of the battle maps dont show up. Still works though
-- if you are the server, you can press F10, to select a random track. This will not
include Battle Maps, only Race Maps
